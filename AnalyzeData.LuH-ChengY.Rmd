# Introduction 

  This report presents the results of two analytically queries performed on the 
MySQL data warehouse from Part 2. The queries were designed to provide insights 
on the journals with the most articles published and the number of articles per 
journal per year, broken down by quarter.

## Set up connection
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 1. Library (must be installed prior to loading
library(RMySQL)
library(DBI)### MySQL

# 2. Initial settings
db_user <- 'root'
db_password <- 'cerf0312*'
db_name <- 'Journal'

db_host <- 'localhost' 
db_port <- 3306 # always this port unless you change it during installation

# 3. Connect to the database
mydb <-  dbConnect(MySQL(), user = db_user, password = db_password,
                   dbname = db_name, host = db_host, 
                   port = db_port, local_infile = TRUE)
```

# Query I: Top Five Journals with the Most Articles Published

  The top five journals with the most articles published in them for the 
time period are as follows:

## Code part
```{sql QUERY 1, connection=mydb}

SELECT
    Title, year, num_articles
FROM
    journal_facts
WHERE year <= '1999' and year >= '1977'
ORDER BY num_articles 
DESC LIMIT 5
```
# Query II: Number of Articles per Journal per Year, Broken Down by Quarter
  The following table shows the number of articles per journal per year, 
broken down by quarter:

## Code part

```{sql QUERY 2, connection=mydb}
SELECT 
    year, quarter, Title, num_articles
FROM journal_facts
ORDER BY year, quarter
```
# Table > Visiualizaiton

In this case, I suppose that a table is better than a visualization.

1) Detail: A table can present a lot more detail than a visualization can. In this case, we need to display multiple metrics or dimensions, a table can show all of them in a compact form. With a visualization, it may need multiple charts or graphs to show the same amount of detail.

2) Precision: A table can provide exact values, while a visualization can only provide estimates. This can be important in certain situations where exact numbers are critical.

3) Comparison: A table can make it easier to compare values between different rows or columns. This is especially true when the table has been sorted or filtered in a specific way. With a visualization, it may be more difficult to make precise comparisons.

```{r}
dbDisconnect(mydb)
```
